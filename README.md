## üíé Core Innovation: The Triple-Threat Architecture

This application masterfully combines three advanced capabilities‚Äîa technical trifecta that elevates its performance far beyond conventional demos.

| Capability | What It Delivers | Visual Proof |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Grounded Intelligence (RAG)** | Facts, not fantasy. By integrating the **Google Search tool**, the Oracle accesses the live web, eliminating model "hallucinations" and providing all answers with **verifiable, cited sources**. | ![Screenshot of Citations](image_be77c6.png) |
| **Zero-Latency Streaming** | No more waiting. The use of token-level streaming ensures text appears instantly, giving the user a **fast, modern, and high-performance** conversational flow. | ![Screenshot of Streaming](image_bdfbad.png) |
| **Strategic Persona Engineering** | We didn't build a generalist. A meticulously crafted **System Instruction** forces the Gemini model to adopt the voice of a **"World-Class Strategic Analyst,"** guaranteeing concise, high-value insights. | ![Screenshot of Persona](image_be6507.png) |
| **Fluid Conversation Memory** | Seamless multi-turn dialogue is ensured through Streamlit's session state, allowing for complex, context-aware user journeys without losing track. | ![Screenshot of Chat History](image_bd1db1.png) |

## üõ†Ô∏è The Engine Room: Tech Stack & Deployment

### Core Technologies

* **AI Model:** Google Gemini API (`google-genai` SDK)
* **Frontend:** Streamlit (Python, for lightning-fast UI deployment)
* **Design Pattern:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

### Quick Start: Launch the Oracle

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git)
    cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    All required libraries are listed in `requirements.txt`.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Set Your API Key:**
    * Obtain your key from [Google AI Studio].
    * Securely set it as the **`GEMINI_API_KEY`** environment variable (or within a local `.env` file). **Crucially, never commit your key to GitHub.**

4.  **Initiate the Application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
